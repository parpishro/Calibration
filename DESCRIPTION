Description: FBC provides employs a Full Bayesian Calibration method to calibrate the simulator 
             model using both field observations and simulator outputs. It is based on Kennedy and 
             O'Hagan (2001) calibration model and uses Metropolis-Within Gibbs MCMC algorithm with 
             adaptive proposal.
